# F3x-Transfer-Tool
This is where files and instructions for my F3X transfer tool macro live.

# ---- MASSIVE DISCLAIMER ----

this is an incredibly temperamental tool  
it uses macros to essentially play back a human building at the maximum possible speed  
it is not endorsed or developed by any f3x developer  
i am not liable for any damages that may occur to your system in the use of this tool if something goes awry and the bot clicks something it shouldnt
